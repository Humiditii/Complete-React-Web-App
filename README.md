# React Course
The code from The Complete React Web App Developer course from
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course).

The completed Weather app is available at
[Weather Oracle](http://weather-oracle.herokuapp.com).

The completed Clocks app is available at
[Reactive Clocks](http://reactive-clocks.herokuapp.com).

The Work in Progress Todo app is available at
[Reactive Agenda](http://reactive-agenda.herokuapp.com).

## Directories

I have successively started new directories during the course, in this order (I think)

* Hello-React
* First-Component
* Nested-Components
* First-Webpack
* React-Boilerplate
* React-Weather
* Weather-Foundation - Final version of Weather App
* React-Boilerplate-2
* React-Clocks
* React-Boilerplate-3
* React-Todo
* playground

## Status

So far, completed section 9 - Todo App with localStorage.

### Important

My code for the Todo App uses the word 'task' in almost all places where Andrew is using 'todo'.
I have also made some of my other components and classes different from his.

That includes

* TodoApp.state.todos -> TodoApp.state.tasks
* Todo -> TodoTask
* AddTodo -> TodoForm
* TodoAPI.getTodos / setTodos -> TodoAPI.getTasks / setTasks
