# React Course
The code from The Complete React Web App Developer course from
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course).

The completed Weather app is available at [Weather Oracle](http://weather-oracle.herokuapp.com/).

## Directories

I have successively started new directories during the course, in this order (I think)

* Hello-React
* First-Component
* Nested-Components
* First-Webpack
* React-Boilerplate
* React-Weather
* Weather-Foundation

## Status

So far, completed section 7 - Foundation and custom styling.
